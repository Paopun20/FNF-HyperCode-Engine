## **Key Features**

- **Custom Menus [Should be stable now?]**  
  Create menus with HScript! This allows for complex and customizable menu designs.

- **Optimized Garbage Collection**  
  Enjoy smoother gameplay with less performance hitching. Your mods will run smoother, even with complex beats.

- **C++11 Codebase**  
  A modern C++11 codebase for better performance and compatibility with newer systems.

- **Buffer [Work in Progress]**  
  Buffers allow for more efficient data handling, improving overall performance by temporarily storing data in memory.

- **3D Model Support [!! Work in Progress !!]**  
  3D model support is now available! and still has many bugs, it's an exciting addition for more visually appealing scenes.
